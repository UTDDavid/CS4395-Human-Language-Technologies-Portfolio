A fascinating insight into how games tap into the console's power.Back in the day it was all about FRAPS.For decades now, PC users have relied on real-time on-screen displays with frame-rate counters and system monitoring tools to give them some idea of how their PCs are being utilised during gaming.For decades now, PC users have relied on real-time on-screen displays with frame-rate counters and system monitoring tools to give them some idea of how their PCs are being utilised during gaming.But what if similar tools were available to console users?Frame-rates, CPU/GPU utilisation, temperature monitors, fan speeds: all are exposed, giving us a fascinating insight into how Switch titles pushe the hardware during gaming.Of course, this is all limited to earlier Switch revisions, vulnerable to a recovery mode hardware exploit on which custom firmware was developed.Yes, you can run these tools yourself but there is a route to piracy here - so not surprisingly, consoles attached to Nintendo's online gaming service are routinely banned.But the interesting part from the Digital Foundry perspective is the flourishing homebrew environment, which recently saw the release of the Tesla frame-work - code that runs on the Switch's reserved CPU core, bringing up an interactive overlay at any time during gaming.Voila: full real-time system analysis - but what does it reveal?Well, at the most basic level, you get instant confirmation that Nintendo does indeed reserve one of the Switch's CPU cores for the OS and front-end - the overlay shows cores zero to two essentially dormant while navigating the shell, with only core three active as the menus are traversed.Similarly, there's on-screen confirmation that Switch's docked clocks are totally locked during gameplay: 1020MHz for the CPU, 768MHz for the GPU, 1600MHz on the EMC (embedded memory controller).However, there is a twist and it's something we've covered before, that we can now see play out in real-time - Nintendo's 'boost mode'.For example, when you die in Mario Odyssey, the screen fades to black and the game loads you back to the last checkpoint.The system monitor overlay also reveals how certain titles have pushed Switch hardware to the point where Nintendo has stepped in to provide tweaked performance mode at the OS level - something that, outside of boost mode, only applies to portable configurations.The system monitor overlay also reveals how certain titles have pushed Switch hardware to the point where Nintendo has stepped in to provide tweaked performance mode at the OS level - something that, outside of boost mode, only applies to portable configurations.Perhaps the developers opted for standard clocks in order to preserve battery life, as users are more likely to put in extended game sessions on an RPG.One of the most fascinating results from the system monitor tool is the concept of dynamic changes to clocks in portable mode.A while back, patches were released for the earlier id Tech 6 ports that improved performance and I wonder if it's related to this.The system monitor overlay also gives us detailed information on Switch's thermals too.Our understanding is that Nintendo has a developer mode which puts the CPU at 1220MHz - a 19.6 per cent improvement to standard clocks.Our tests demonstrate that doing so via homebrew OC tool sysclk doesn't melt the battery and helps to mitigate a lot of performance problems in many, many games.The system monitor overlay shows that titles like Smash Bros Ultimate, Doom, Wolfenstein and Luigi's Mansion 3 all push the CPU to over 90 per cent utilisation - and extra overhead there could certainly help to boost performance.Whether it's through access to the silicon for monitoring purposes, overclocking system components or even tweaking games (as we saw recently with The Witcher 3), the work being carried out on the system by the modding community has allowed us to get a much deeper, fuller understanding of how the console hybrid works and how Nintendo continues to evolve its performance.Whether it's through access to the silicon for monitoring purposes, overclocking system components or even tweaking games (as we saw recently

11, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey analysed.Let's get straight to the point - Switch is indeed evolving and in select scenarios, Nintendo's hardware is becoming more powerful than it was at launch.Recent stories talking about a 'boost mode' of sorts for the console hybrid are perhaps a touch inaccurate, but after investigating a trio of recent releases, it's now confirmed that Nintendo is selectively overclocking its hardware - or more precisely, opening up new options for developers to beef up portable performance while at the same time playing with thermal management and CPU clocks to speed up loading times.Way back in December 2016, Digital Foundry revealed the clock speed configurations Nintendo settled upon for Switch - and there was some concern.Recent stories talking about a 'boost mode' of sorts for the console hybrid are perhaps a touch inaccurate, but after investigating a trio of recent releases, it's now confirmed that Nintendo is selectively overclocking its hardware - or more precisely, opening up new options for developers to beef up portable performance while at the same time playing with thermal management and CPU clocks to speed up loading times.Way back in December 2016, Digital Foundry revealed the clock speed configurations Nintendo settled upon for Switch - and there was some concern.The situation was even more concerning in mobile mode, where the GPU downclocked to just 307.2MHz - though pre-launch, Nintendo added a beefier 384MHz mode to the mix.Recent developments have spiced up the situation somewhat, with further options open to game makers.Two elements define how long - or how short - any given load is: the performance of the storage in bringing data into memory and the speed of the CPU in decompressing the data the system receives (storage space is at a premium, so data is compressed to save space).Using an exploited Switch running frequency management and monitoring software (SysClk) I was able to see the Nintendo hardware boot Mario and Zelda with CPU clocks at 1785MHz, before throttling back to the standard 1020MHz once the load was complete.The most power hungry component of the Tegra X1 processor is undoubtedly the Nvidia Maxwell graphics hardware, but typically, when games are loading, GPU utilisation barely registers.Booting Super Mario Odyssey took 28 seconds before the latest patch (where I confirmed CPU clocks to be locked at 1020MHz), whereas the latest version with the 'boost' code applied loads the game in 20 seconds - a 29 per cent decrease.Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey appear to have received the 460MHz portable play upclock first, with NetherRealms' Mortal Kombat 11 the first third-party title to have access to the new mode.Using an exploited Switch, SysClk's frequency monitoring also allows users to overclock and indeed underclock their hardware.Any such unauthorised modification comes with the risk of seeing your console banned from accessing Nintendo's online services, so going down this route is not recommended but for Digital Foundry, it was the only way to conclusively confirm what changes Nintendo is making to clock speeds - and in turn, performance.As you may expect with a circa 50 per cent reduction in GPU frequency, performance collapses when the game is forced to the 307.2MHz mode.There does seem to be a 1224MHz CPU clock mode officially supported, but I've not seen it deployed in any games and it may well be there to give game makers some processor overhead in running debugging tools during development.The EMC (embedded memory controller) runs at 1600MHz when docked, dropping to 1331MHz during portable play.This can be locked to 1600MHz in mobile mode via SysClk with very little impact to battery life - and in select circumstances, it can help game performance.For example, there are reports that the stutter found in Korok forest area of Breath of the Wild when gaming on the go is improved significantly simply by tweaking up memory bandwidth to the docked spec, leaving everything else at stock settings.There, the user decides whether the extra CPU or GPU power is deployed, whereas the ball is firmly in the developer's court on Switch.Years on from launch, Nintendo has pushed the Switch hardware to deliver more performance, and I'll be fascinated to see where they go next.Digital Foundry specialises in technical analysis of gaming hardware and software, using state-of-the-art capture systems and bespoke software to show you how well games and hardware run,

about the system, but the teardown is something else.These specs are also in the big July 2016 dev portal leak, and we can confirm that the same information still sits on the Switch developer portal.Updates to aspects such as clock-speeds are added in further SDK updates, beyond the scope of the leak.The July 2016 data also suggests that one of the four ARM cores is reserved for the system, while the odd fill-rate spec we've discussed in the past (it should be 16 pixels per cycle for Tegra X1, not 14.4) may suggest that the Switch also reserves 10 per cent of GPU time for the system too.Again, these elements have not been adjusted to the best of our knowledge, but we suspect that in common with the clocks, any changes may have been communicated to developers via specific updates.An interesting theory is that these widely leaked specs pertain to dev kit hardware that is long since obsolete.However, nowhere in the documentation does Nintendo say that these specs refer to incomplete hardware, and developers continued to be briefed on this hardware configuration even after the October 2016 reveal of the hardware.A couple of weeks ago, the July 2016 leak effectively handed over almost everything we need to know about the hardware, but some of the details are at odds with a very specific leak from Chinese manufacturer, Foxconn, which is clearly based on first-hand knowledge of the Switch hardware, presumably from within its production facility.In real life applications, the rise in graphics capabilities would be very useful but not exactly game-changing - but the CPU uplift certainly would change the outlook of the system's capabilities, allowing for much more complex game logic, animation and physics.However, as much as we want the Foxconn clocks to be real, the weight of evidence is stacking up against this aspect of the leak.In real life applications, the rise in graphics capabilities would be very useful but not exactly game-changing - but the

the weight of evidence is stacking up against this aspect of the leak.If the frequencies reported there were ever running on Switch, we believe they may well have been a stress test of thermal limits on the X1-derived hardware, designed to offer Nintendo a best-case scenario on just how far the processor could be pushed with its chosen cooling assembly, before finalising its retail specification.Beyond that, we also wonder whether using the 384MHz mode may come with compromises elsewhere in the system - perhaps by disabling WiFi (PS Vita also had multiple performance modes and one of them did turn off WiFi in order to repurpose the power budget).Shield uses two 1.5GB modules, while Switch ups that to a 2x 2GB configuration for 4GB of total system memory.The precise parts are still unconfirmed but the configuration strongly suggests a 64-bit memory bus, again tying in with the existing Switch spec leaks and ruling out the 128-bit interface used with the Pascal-based 16nm Tegra X2.On top of all this data and analysis, we can add an additional metric on top - power consumption from the wall in docked mode, measured from final retail Switch hardware.However, if Switch were utilising a 16nm processor, the chances are that power consumption would be considerably lower.While there is still the possibility of a more refined SoC within the retail hardware, the bottom line is that Switch has a processor that looks like a Tegra X1, with specs from Nintendo in line with X1, and power consumption that fits the characteristics of the chip's 20nm fabrication process (and power draw analysis of the second Shield revision may prove illuminating as a closer comparison point).To what extent Nintendo and Nvidia have customised the technology remains unknown - but major revisions to the hardware would almost certainly have resulted in a noticeable change in dimensions for the final silicon compared to Tegra X1, something that isn't apparent on the Switch SoC.While the teardown photos, prior leaks and new developer documentation all point towards mature Tegra technology inside the Switch, the fact remains that this is by far and away the most powerful handheld console ever made, backed by a dedicated API designed to extract maximum performance from the hardware.To what extent Nintendo and Nvidia have customised the technology remains unknown - but

considerable, which may require graphical compromises when gaming on the go.At this point, the spec story may well have run its course, but in the run-up to launch, this is actually where things get really interesting.Next week, we'll have a full hardware review, plus detailed Zelda Switch and Wii U analysis, and we look forward to sharing our results.Digital Foundry specialises in technical

slumps where it fell behind rivals after misjudging trends.Now the company has revealed a big part of its plan for regaining its leadership in gaming.The Japanese game giant provided the first look at a new console it is developing that will do double-duty as a portable game system outside the home and one that will serve in the traditional role, connected to television sets.Other game companies have toyed around with similar approaches in the past with limited success, but the Nintendo Switch, as the device is called, is the first from a marquee games company to so assertively seek to erase the boundaries between home and mobile gaming.“Nintendo Switch allows gamers the freedom to play however they like,” Reggie Fils-Aimé, the president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said in a statement.Now the company has revealed a big part of its plan for regaining its leadership in gaming.The Japanese game giant provided the first look at a new console it is developing that

reality experiences through their consoles.Nintendo, in contrast, has been more concerned with giving gamers novel ways of playing games, rather than creating the most immersive experiences possible.It struck gold with the motion controllers of the Wii and has one of the most powerful stables of game franchises under its control, including Mario and Zelda.It later stumbled with a successor console, the Wii U, that used a tablet-like controller as a secondary screen to televisions.At the same time, Nintendo largely ignored the explosive growth of mobile gaming on smartphones

fun.”AdvertisementNintendo Creative Fellow and game design luminary Shigeru Miyamoto is renowned for his work on foundational franchises like Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda.But there are a few things you may not know about the 64-year-old gaming celeb, like what he thinks of artificial intelligence or what he’s been doing in his spare time.I think that the idea of Nintendo Switch being a device you can take out and anywhere, and the idea of it being a system that really allows networking and communicating with people, I think that’s something Mr. Iwata put a lot of emphasis on.Because Mr. Iwata was tech-savvy, a lot of our discussion involved trying to figure out how to make the technical things like network capabilities or servers or whatever fun.For example, think about when we added the ability to use a browser on the DS [Nintendo’s two-screen gaming handheld—the browser was added to North American systems in 2007].What are your thoughts these days on story in games?Let me start off by saying that Mr. Aonuma [Eiji Aonuma, the game’s producer] and his team, instead of creating a game where you’re playing the story, you yourself are embarking on an adventure, and I think they’ve found a unique way to strike a balance between the story and the fact that you’re on an adventure.I think after someone has played a game, it’s important that a story lingers in their mind.And so in this game, while you’re playing, you start to kind of dig the narrative out and see the overarching story that lies in the background.And so I think the story in Breath of the Wild still doesn’t break the balance that’s been established in previous Zelda games.But we also wanted to make a game where, after someone is done playing, their own experience in that game is what the story is, and I think we’ve been able to accomplish that with this title.And really in this game, everybody can take very, very different routes and approaches.How long it takes to beat the game has a huge range.Mr.Some of the biggest advances in artificial intelligence may come from games, or at least be built on advances in game design.For things like robots or A.I., it’s really about how you set up the sensors, and obviously Nintendo is a company that’s really interested in different kinds of sensors.Is there anything in particular, when you think of the next 10 years, that you’d like to accomplish, in or out of gaming?As a company, we’ve carefully gotten ourselves involved in the mobile industry, and that’s something that I was personally involved in.Then with the Nintendo Switch, the idea of having a console that’s also a portable device, I think that opens up new doors to all kinds of possibilities.)Write to Matt Peckham at matt.peckham@time.com.Browse open positions

posted its quarterly financial results late last month, but the investor Q&A session that follows the report is often loaded with additional insight into Nintendo's inner workings and decisions.Following only weeks after the announcement of Nintendo Labo, this quarter’s session touched on some interesting things about both the Labo build-a-kit accessory pack and the unique Joy-Con controllers it was created to supplement.For example, Nintendo director and managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi says that the idea for Labo emerged from the idea of setting the Switch’s detachable Joy-Con controllers (which he describes as “a mass of sensors”) into external attachments.But, as Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto explains later in the Q&A, the original idea that blossomed into Joy-Cons and Labo is much older than that.“[The] Wii is a much-talked-about example of Nintendo’s experience of success, but the developers began to rethink their hardware design after receiving feedback from global users of Wii Sports and Wii Fit, saying things like the Wii Remote should have had different design features, or should have been small enough to attach to the leg,” said Miyamoto.“Because of that rethinking, our developers thought constructively about the advantages of miniaturizing the game controller, and when the technology advanced to give controllers greater functionality in a smaller size, it was not lost on them that here was an opportunity to create a console-type game system that could be carried around like a handheld video game system.“[The] Wii is

device had already sold out in Japan, forcing him to look elsewhere.While Mr. Kazdal had bought Nintendo’s previous console, the Wii U, a few years earlier, he soon had buyer’s remorse.Losses were piling up.But thanks largely to the arrival of the Switch in March, Nintendo has had a startling turnaround year.The new console became the fastest-selling video game system in Nintendo’s history — to

provided a revenue lift.But the major reason for the company’s recent success has been its ability to identify and correct several problems with the Wii U, a console it released in 2012.Third-party

device or as a more traditional console.The console, Mr. Miyamoto said, combines “all of the different play styles we’ve explored through our products in the past.”The system features novelties of its own too: the detachable controllers allow two players to compete or collaborate without the need for additional hardware.“I became particularly interested in the Switch because of the controllers,” said Nele Steenput, a 30-year-old artist from Oxford, England.The console, Mr. Miyamoto said, combines “all of the different play styles we’ve explored through our products in the past.”The system

characters pummel one another with elastic limbs that can be given different deadly appendages.In October, the company released Super Mario Odyssey, a game that, for the first time in the series’ history, took Mario to destinations that looked like real-world locations, like New York City.“We have deliberately maintained a pace of content that we were unable to achieve with the Wii U,” said Reginald Fils-Aimé, president of Nintendo of America.This output is being led by a new generation of young game designers overseen by Shinya Takahashi, a little-known executive who has recently taken over Nintendo’s hardware and software divisions.“While we were truly saddened by Iwata’s passing, it came at a time when new leaders were rising in the company,” Mr. Takahashi, 54, said.Even people like Mr. Miyamoto, 65, a leading figure at Nintendo since the 1980s, is ceding control at the company’s Japanese headquarters.“More and more I am trying to let the younger generation fully take the reins,” Mr. Miyamoto said.This younger generation has been carefully chosen; Mr. Miyamoto says he wants people who are more likely to create new kinds of play, rather than merely aim to perfect current ones.“I always look for designers who aren’t super-passionate game fans,” Mr. Miyamoto said.Other inventive games have followed, like ARMS, a boxing game in which characters pummel one another

difficulty when the company has announced no major releases from its own Mario and Zelda franchises to persuade buyers.That means Nintendo will need outside developers to provide critical support.That makes it more expensive to build a game that works for all three brands.But with the Switch, Nintendo has worked hard to court support of major publishers such as Ubisoft, EA and Bethesda.In November, the Japanese game studio Square-Enix told investors that, in addition to researching which of its games could be brought to Nintendo’s system, it will also be “aggressively making games for Switch.”Nintendo has also been courting smaller game makers, referring to independent developers who bring their games to the Switch as “Nindies.” Some have already enjoyed success.In November, the

could potentially run for a longer period of time.Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto said during a recent investor Q&A  that he believes the Switch stands to be successful for a long time to come due to its unique hybrid nature and Nintendo's efforts to create compelling content that leverages the system's unique attributes."When you think about what can be done with the Nintendo Switch as a device that can be taken on the go and that every person has in their hands to play, you realise it has many features not available on any other hardware to date," Miyamoto said."Nintendo also has a system in place whereby the software developers focus on these hardware features in their development efforts for the continuation of the Nintendo Switch business."Nintendo also has a system in place whereby the software developers focus on these hardware features in their development efforts for the continuation of the Nintendo Switch business."He added: "Up until now, the hardware lifecycle has trended at around five or six years, but it would be very interesting if we could prolong that life cycle, and I think you should be looking forward to that.If Nintendo's prediction comes true and the Switch has a lifecycle longer than 5-6 years, we could see it still in the market into 2023 and potentially beyond depending on how things go.Some of Nintendo's biggest franchises have already been released on the Switch (Super Mario, Mario Kart, and Zelda are among them) but fans are still waiting for a Super Smash Bros. game.Email news@gamespot.comUse your keyboard!Log in to commentIt's been almost a year and a half since Nintendo announced the NX, and now the gaming giant has finally dropped the codename and secrecy in favor of something more official: Switch.Like the countless rumors previously asserted, it's indeed a hybrid mobile and home console with a tablet element and detachable controllers.The tablet itself (which Nintendo calls "the Switch Console") is thin and pretty attractive.In the trailer, a gamer slides what looks to be a 3DS-style cartridge into the tablet, meaning games are likely to distributed both digitally and physically.It's powered by an unspecified custom Nvidia Tegra processor, which is "based on the same architecture as the world's top-performing GeForce gaming graphics cards."They can be attached to a central unit called the "Joy-Con Grip" to behave like a single game controller, but also slide onto the side of the tablet for a more Wii U-like experience.They can be attached to a central unit called the "Joy-Con Grip" to behave like a single game

Switch, a shape-changing console that doubles as a traditional home-based machine and a smaller portable device.Nintendo’s share price fell 6.6 percent on Friday in trading in Tokyo.What is the Nintendo Switch, and what’s riding on it?The Nintendo Switch is an all-in-one gaming machine, essentially a compact processor with removable controllers and a screen, which can be configured for playing at home (with a television) or on the go.It is a big deal for Nintendo, the Japanese game giant, which has fallen behind rivals in hardware.It is a big deal for Nintendo, the Japanese game

dramatically expanded the audience for gaming, attracting millions of so-called casual players.Nintendo reshaped the console market in the mid-2000s with its innovative Wii, whose motion-sensitive controllers and relatively simple games dramatically expanded the audience for gaming, attracting millions of so-called casual players.The Wii’s strengths — simplicity and affordability — turned into weaknesses once phones became the go-to game platform for casual players.Fewer new games meant even less appeal.So is the Nintendo Switch a strategic, er, switch?Not really.Nintendo faced a choice: fight Sony and Microsoft for hard-core game fans, or try a new way of appealing to casual gamers.The Nintendo Switch, to judge from the company’s early marketing, is aimed at people who like games enough to want to play them on dedicated hardware (not just a smartphone) but not so much that they will lock themselves in their rooms all day with a PlayStation or an Xbox.Serkan Toto, a game industry analyst in Tokyo, doubts it.Nintendo “masterfully captured” casual gamers with the Wii, he wrote on Twitter, but today few are likely to turn away from their phones, especially when it means paying several hundred dollars for a console.Even committed console buyers are willing to jump between brands if it means getting a better deal; with casual gamers, a steep price could “break the device’s neck,” Mr. Toto said.What if the Nintendo Switch is a dud?That would be bad for Nintendo, obviously, but the company is about more than just hardware — especially recently.Even committed

can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach.Its future could lie in unlocking similar value from a game catalog that includes Mario Brothers, Zelda and other popular titles.AdvertisementFront page layoutSite

streak on Wednesday night with Nintendo's help.Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime joined Fallon on stage with an iPhone in hand (and a slick Mario pin on his lapel) to show off the first full-level run of Super Mario Run we've yet to see—but this moment was quickly overshadowed by a "one more thing" reveal: the Nintendo Switch console.Its future could lie in unlocking similar value

Fils-Aime joined Fallon on stage with an iPhone in hand (and a slick Mario pin on his lapel) to show off the first full-level run of Super Mario Run we've yet to see—but this moment was quickly overshadowed by a "one more thing" reveal: the Nintendo Switch console.Even better, it was shown off running The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the first time; all previous footage of that game ran on the Wii U console.Fils-Aime showed off the Switch's fun party trick of working whether plugged into the hub (and, therefore, an HDTV) or taken on the go as a handheld system.Even better, it was shown off running The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the first time; all previous footage of that game ran on the Wii U console.Fils-Aime showed off the Switch's fun party trick of working whether plugged into the hub (and, therefore, an HDTV) or taken on the go as a handheld system.We also got a hint of how long the system takes to transition from home mode to portable mode; Fils-Aime pulled the Switch out of the dock, at which point a small white box appeared on the smaller, handheld screen, as if to indicate a load.Speaking of the Switch's backside: we can now confirm the existence of two triggers on each Joy-Con (or four in all), with L, R, ZL, and ZR buttons, which weren't as visible in the system's launch commercial.We also got a better look at one of the system's giant vent openings, along with what may be the Switch's docking slot, seen as a miniature indentation in the bottom-middle of the system's backside.Next to that slot, by the way, is a port that looks very much like a USB Type-C connector (which people already believed was coming to Switch).Before handing Fallon the Switch, Fils-Aime controlled the Zelda demo with a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and this allowed viewers to see the game on Fallon's big-screen TV.Having seen demos of Breath of the Wild in person and on TV before, I was impressed to see the game's Switch version operating with fewer "hazy" visual filters, crisper resolution, and smoother frame rates (though it also had some visible aliasing artifacts).The Switch screen also looked slick and bright in Fallon's hands, though when the studio lights shone directly on it, the screen's anti-glare coating could be seen—as could the game's crisp, smooth performance when unplugged from the dock.After the gameplay segment ended, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto took the opportunity to sit in with Fallon's house band, The Roots, on acoustic guitar, to play a rendition of the Super Mario Bros. overworld theme song.The song didn't have any bluegrass flair in particular, which Miyamoto has said in interviews is his favorite genre to play, but it still proved a rare public appearance of the game maker playing live instruments.The Super Mario Run segment was less impressive, as it repeated details we'd heard at events such as its Apple keynote reveal.Fallon tried and failed to grab all five red coins in the main campaign level he played, and he didn't sample the game's kingdom simulator mode, whose details are still scant.The game comes out December 12 on iOS platforms (with an Android launch coming next year) for $10, but Fils-Aime announced on Fallon that eager fans can try the game starting Thursday.That's when every Apple Store in the US will let visitors play the game's free trial demo.Fallon opened the show with a vague hint that Nintendo would show off "something new" in the episode, and the Nintendo Switch hands-on reveal was certainly the payoff we were hoping for.Thanks to dev kits landing in more developers' hands this week, more leaks have begun to filter out about the system, including Switch's emulation support for the GameCube and an estimated 5-8 hours of battery life—which will likely be boosted by the quick-charge capabilities of the USB Type-C standard.Fallon opened the show by dropping the kind of Nintendo-specific trivia that you'd expect from the film

president of the Japanese  gaming giant, told reporters at an event on Friday.Nintendo shares tumbled 5.75 percent to 23,750 yen at the  close of trade, and commentators said the higher than  expected retail price of the console fanned concerns over the  product's viability.Given the fierce competition in the console  market, pricing is a key factor for the success of the Nintendo  Switch, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal told CNBC's "Squawk  Box" on Friday before the announcement.Switch is a hybrid gaming system that is part gaming console,  part handheld device and part tablet.Switch is a

announced Switch - previously called the  NX - there was a lot of buzz around the so-called Joy-Con  controllers, which can be split into two separate gaming  controllers.They come with motion control sensors, including an  infrared camera on the right Joy-con that can sense the  shape, motion and distance of objects before the  controller.This opens the possibility of a new form of  player-versus-player gaming as Nintendo demonstrated with two new  game titles 1,2 Switch and Arms.This opens the possibility of a new form of  player-versus-player gaming as Nintendo demonstrated

agreed that titles available on the Switch,  along with the console's functionality, could make it a big hit  among gamers.Among  the notable names showcased were Splatoon 2 and Super Mario  Odyssey, which is set to be released during the holiday season  later in the year, and role-playing game titles such  as Xenoblade Chronicle 2, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the  Wild - launching on Mar.Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese gaming consultant Kantan Games said,  "Microsoft and Sony have had this for years...they were giving  away free games on a monthly basis for years.Global Business and

hear our 2020 predictions and a preview of the year ahead?No part of this website or its content may be reproduced without the copyright owner's permission.It’s time to switch.After what seems like an eternity since the late Satoru Iwata announced Nintendo’s next piece of hardware, what was previously known as the NX is finally here.After months of excitement, hype, and disappointment, followed by more hype (repeat ad nauseum), the system is now available and quite literally in gamer’s hands.It’s also the first time that I’ve genuinely been excited for a Nintendo system in more than a decade.You also get the Joy-Con grip, which can be used as a more traditional (and somewhat surprisingly, comfortable) controller.Even the plastic dock bundled in the package seems very tiny in comparison to normal hardware.Given that this new hybrid system is retailing for £279.99, you’d expect that.When all connected together, the system is more long than it is big; it’s certainly bigger than a PlayStation Vita and wider (but shorter) than a Wii U gamepad.We also know that the system is more powerful than the Wii U and the PlayStation Vita, but not quite at the same level as a standard PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.Moving on to more specific specifications, the Switch is packed with 32GB of on board storage – although only ~25.9GB is available to you on first boot.Currently save game files are stored to the internal memory with no way of transferring them over, so that’s something to keep in mind as well.The system ships with a 4310 mAh 3.7 V lithium-ion battery, and official longevity in handheld mode varies from 2.5 to 6 hours.Currently save game files are stored to the internal memory with no way of transferring them over, so that’s something to keep in mind as

computational intensity of the game will affect this.It’s not often Nintendo have nailed the design of their hardware at the first iteration, but the Switch is one sexy machine, and it all feels so incredibly premium.Obviously how bright the screen is, the volume level, and the computational intensity of the game will affect this.It’s not often Nintendo have nailed the design of their hardware

it really looks fantastic.There are a few niggles with the design though, and one of them follows the fact that the unit features a kickstand for using the console in “Table Top” form.Another issue is the flimsiness of the cover for the game cards; it’s literally thin tabs of plastic securing this to your console.Another issue is the flimsiness of the cover for the game cards; it’s literally thin tabs of plastic securing this to your console.Any worries I had about removing or attaching them instantly disappeared.The system them prompted me to set the date, time, language, and a nickname for myself – all accompanied by incremental audio prompts letting me know I was nearly done.Anyone that has spent time with the 3DS system will be happy to hear that!The Switch uses friend codes for online play – despite suggestions that it wouldn’t, although it isn’t as bad as before.There’s also no Virtual Cconsole; although since it’s said that a Virtual Console title will be part of the paid subscription, you can bet it’ll arrive at some point down the line.HybridHow excited you’ll be for Nintendo’s newest hardware will depend on many factors, not least of all how you view it.Nintendo’s eschewed marketing stance places this new technology firmly on the fence with a “unique” ability to be both a handheld and a console in one; and it really changes the way you can play.1-2-Switch is essentially a game you can only play docked or on tabletop mode whilst Voez is the first handheld-only game so games that work on all modes are not guaranteed.With a great weight, balance and size – as well as cleverly hidden “shoulder” buttons on the side, these controllers are also designed to work well as two little controllers for multiplayer gaming.Although no real substitute for a full sized controller, it works very well for short sessions.Built into the technology is motion controls, and as such can operate in a similar manner to a Wii remote.It also has a fabulous rumble system dubbed “HD Rumble” which works incredibly well.Instead, you’d have to shell out additional cash to get the version with a USB port in it if you prefer (or need) to charge separate.The Joy-Con also lack a traditional D-pad, so for those requiring something with this input, you’ll need to get yourself the Switch Pro controller.Packing in all the functionality found within the Joy-Con and having that D-pad, it’s also important to mention that the buttons on the Pro controller are also slightly larger.The Pro controller apparently lasts for around 40 hours (!Of course, Breath of the Wild is no ordinary game – and the launch also possesses some little gems in the form of Snipperclips, Fast RMX, and Shovel Knight.The system has over 150 games announced already, and with a fusion of first party titles, third party efforts, and an abundance of indie developers all getting behind the system, it won’t be long before the Switch has too many games to play!Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the next big Nintendo release – though Arms, Splatoon 2, Fire Emblem Warriors, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Super Mario Odyssey are all expected before the end of the year.Should you buy the Nintendo Switch?Are you are looking for a new system for either at home, on the go, or even both?Nintendo aficionados that fall into this bracket will no doubt already have one, but I cannot sing the praises for the hardware and its potential enough.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  is such an amazing experience, and arguably one of the best launch titles that a console has ever seen.No console is worth buying just for one game, but if there was Breath of the Wild would be that game.No console is worth buying just for one game, but if there was Breath of the Wild would be that game.Is it worth shelling out £340+ to play the game on the Switch when you can just play it on the Wii U?As a predominantly handheld focused gamer, the Switch is almost everything I’d want from a portable console, and it has the added bonus of doubling up as a system I can play on the TV as well.As a predominantly handheld focused gamer, the Switch is almost everything I’d want from a portable console, and it has the added bonus of

marketplace we want?"When asked specifically about 1, 2, Switch and how it seems like the ideal evolution of the Wii Sports-style bundled game, Fils-Aime acknowledged the similarities between the two.However, he disputed this to some degree, arguing 1, 2, Switch is a more comprehensive game."You make the comment about Wii Sports, and certainly, the analogy that it's a great utilization of the Joy-Con and shows off the capabilities of the system, that is absolutely true," Fils-Aime said.And, again, from that standpoint, Wii Play was a standalone piece of software both with a controller at the time and without, so that's probably the better analogy.
