The Switch will be priced at $299.99 in North America and  29,980 yen in Japan, Tatsumi Kimishima, president of the Japanese  gaming giant, told reporters at an event on Friday.  He did not specify a standard price for the European  market. Source: Nintendo   Nintendo shares tumbled 5.75 percent to 23,750 yen at the  close of trade, and commentators said the higher than  expected retail price of the console fanned concerns over the  product's viability. Given the fierce competition in the console  market, pricing is a key factor for the success of the Nintendo  Switch, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal told CNBC's " Squawk  Box " on Friday before the announcement.   Goyal had expected a retail price of $250. Though the Switch  costs about $50 more than what the market expected, the  Switch's pricing is in line with its competitors. The   Sony  PS4's starting price is also $299.99, while  Microsoft 's  Xbox One starts at $249.   Other factors were at play as well for the stock slump.  Seth  Fischer, founder and CIO at Hong Kong-based Oasis Management,  told CNBC's " Capital Connection " that it was likely a case of  "buy(ing) the rumor, sell(ing) the fact" and  that investors were still likely interested in the  stock. watch now VIDEO 1:49 01:49 Nintendo Switch looks very exciting: Investor Capital Connection   Switch is a hybrid gaming system that is part gaming console,  part handheld device and part tablet.  It allows users three  different styles of play: first, they can set the Switch console  in a dock and connect it to their television sets for the more  traditional type of TV mode gaming. They can stand the console up  with a kickstand and play using the Joy-Con controllers in the  Tabletop mode. The Joy-Con controllers can also be attached on  either side of the console for the handheld mode.   When Nintendo initially announced Switch - previously called the  NX - there was a lot of buzz around the so-called Joy-Con  controllers, which can be split into two separate gaming  controllers. They come with motion control sensors, including an  infrared camera on the right Joy-con that can sense the  shape, motion and distance of objects before the  controller.   This opens the possibility of a new form of  player-versus-player gaming as Nintendo demonstrated with two new  game titles 1,2 Switch and Arms. In 1,2 Switch, players take  control of each Joy-Con controller and can play out scenarios  like quick draw shooting and sword fighting without needing to  look at the screen, with their movements determined by the motion  control features in the controller.   The Joy-Con controllers also come with wrist straps  that make the grip easier and are available in black, red and  blue.   The Switch's battery life varies on the games, but Nintendo said  it could be expected to last in a range between 2.5 to 6.5 hours.  The console can be charged using a USB-C charger.   Nintendo has struggled in the gaming console market, following a  disappointing run of its Wii U console, which sold only  about 13.36 million units as of September 2016  since its launch in late  2012 . In contrast, its predecessor, the Nintendo  Wii, sold 101.63 million units as of September last  year  following its launch  in 2006 . watch now VIDEO 1:54 01:54 Nintendo Switch has 50% chance of succeeding: Analyst Squawk Box Asia   In the mobile gaming space, which the Japanese company entered as  late as 2015 with a partnership with DeNA, Nintendo found success  in 2016, first with the successful launch of the  Niantic-developed Pokemon Go mobile game. That was followed by  Nintendo's in-house developed Super Mario Run game that was  rolled out on the iOS platform last December and  garnered about 40 million downloads in 4 days.   Analysts have previously said that one of Nintendo's biggest  competitive advantages is the vast intellectual property it  possesses. Fischer agreed that titles available on the Switch,  along with the console's functionality, could make it a big hit  among gamers.   At the  Tokyo  event, Nintendo announced there were 80 games in  development for the Nintendo Switch from over 50 companies.  Among  the notable names showcased were Splatoon 2 and Super Mario  Odyssey, which is set to be released during the holiday season  later in the year, and role-playing game titles such  as Xenoblade Chronicle 2, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the  Wild - launching on Mar. 3 - and a tease for Fire Emblem  Warriors.  Third party games such as Bethesda's Skyrim and EA  Sports' FIFA will also be available.   Nintendo also announced an online, paid subscription service for  the Switch, with pricing details set to be announced later. Some  analysts felt Nintendo's move into a subscription service was a  little late.   Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese gaming consultant Kantan Games said,  "Microsoft and Sony have had this for years...they were giving  away free games on a monthly basis for years." — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.    — Follow CNBC International on  Twitter  and  Facebook .
